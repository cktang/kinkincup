**1. Information We Collect**

We understand the importance of your privacy. This App is designed to function with minimal data collection.

*   **Precise Location Data:** The App requests access to your device's precise location **only when you explicitly initiate a search** for nearby AEDs by tapping the main button. This location data is used solely for the purpose of finding the AEDs closest to your current position and calculating the distance to them. **Your location data is used temporarily for this calculation and is NOT stored persistently by the App or the Developer.**
*   **AED Image URLs:** The list of nearby AEDs includes image URLs sourced directly from the Hong Kong Fire Services Department website (es.hkfsd.gov.hk). These images are displayed within the app solely for informational purposes to help identify the AED location. **These images or their URLs are not stored by the App or Developer beyond their temporary display in the list.**
*   **Non-Personal Data:** We do not collect any personal identification information (like name, email, address) directly. Underlying frameworks (e.g., Expo services, Apple App Store) may collect anonymized crash reports or basic usage analytics to help maintain and improve the service. Please refer to their respective privacy policies for details.

**2. How We Use Your Information**

*   **Location Data:** Used exclusively to find nearby AEDs and display their distance from you when you request this function.
*   **Reverse Geocoding (Third Party):** To provide you with a readable name for your current location, the App sends your coordinates (latitude and longitude) to the OpenStreetMap Nominatim service (`nominatim.openstreetmap.org`). Your use of this feature is subject to the OpenStreetMap Foundation's Privacy Policy: [https://osmfoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_Policy](https://osmfoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_Policy)
*   **Directions (Third Party):** When you tap on an AED item to get directions, the App uses your device's functionality to open the Google Maps application (or website) with the destination coordinates pre-filled for walking directions. Your interaction with Google Maps is subject to Google's Privacy Policy: [https://policies.google.com/privacy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)

**3. Data Storage and Security**

As stated above, your precise location data is not stored by the Developer. We do not maintain servers for user data storage related to this App.

**4. Children's Privacy**

This App is not intended for use by children under the age of 13 (or the equivalent minimum age in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children.

**5. Changes to This Privacy Policy**

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and potentially within the App Store listing. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.
